# hello-world
followed the GITHUB tutorial

ok, now it forced me to write something here, and I did. @2020/3/15.
Oh, I see that it suggest to write something about myself.
emmm, so I'm now trying to get an offer for Huawei and doing exerises before the test. I feel this is very hard to try to solve problems using the knowledge that I don't ever heard or used. I'm trying to solve them in the stupid way. wish me luck!

Now I'm work for SVW in Shanghai, a no-coding job. I continusously saying that I want to become a coder, to solve problems by my own, but I'm not that self-driven type and always quit when blocked at somewhere. I'm a little afraid of lusing this interest on coding if I really get a developer job. But this shouldn't be a excuse of stopping learning. That's all.
